How my game works:

My game is a survival game where you begin with the starter gun, a pistol, that has been modified to be weaker 
than the original one. So when you go into the building and play the game, when you get shot at you gain coins. 
Then when you die and restart you have the coins you have earned and are able to buy the powerups/guns/ammo/health
available in the outside area. The guns available have been modified and the powerups have been slightly modified. 
Have fun!

My Personal Deliverables-

-respawn back at base instead of just dying w/persistent stats 

-5 craftable items (health, armor, guns, etc.)

-5 upgradable stats(reload time, build time)

-Resource to build and or grow(find or earn on death)

-different weapons to fit theme
